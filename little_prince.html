As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
<span class = "line1">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. </span>
<span class = "line2">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
<span class = "line3">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...”</span>
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: 
<span class = "line4">What moves me so deeply,about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower-the image of a rose that shines through
his whole being like the flame of a lmap, even when he is asleep..."</span>
And I felt him to be more fragile still.
<span class = "line5">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...
